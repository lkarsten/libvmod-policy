VPOL protocol
=============

This is a request-response protocol.

A client sends a request message, and receives a response message back.
If the server does not respond, it must be safe to retry the request.

The first 12 bytes of a request must be a VPOL header, consisting of:

	char[4] "VPOL"
	uint32 meta_length
	uint32 header_length
	uint64 body_length

this header is followed by meta_length + header_length + body_length octets
of data.

(what about gzip? very important if we do this in vcl_backend_response as well)

Request message
---------------

A request message has three parts:

1) metadata; key: value.
2) headers
3) body


Response message
----------------


Currently defined as a two-octet string:

	"OK" (permit this)
	"NO" (do not permit this)

To be expanded upon.
