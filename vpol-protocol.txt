VPOL protocol
=============

This is a request-response protocol.

A client sends a request message, and receives a response message back.
If the server does not respond, it must be safe to retry the request.

The first 16 bytes of a request and response must be a VPOL header, consisting
of:

	char[6] "VPOL01"
	uint16 rcode
	uintXX vxid (called xid in 3.0)
	uint32 meta_length
	uint32 header_length
	uint64 body_length

This header is followed by the respective number of meta, header and body
octets. There is no end marker.

The policy daemon may shut down the connection after handling a request.

Request message
---------------

A request message is sent from Varnish to a policy daemon.

rcode should always be set to numeric 0.
vxid is the request ID as defined by Varnish.

A request message body has three parts:
1) Metadata
List of hardcoded keys, with their respective values. \n delimited.

2) Request headers
The HTTP request headers as key/values, delimited with \n.

3) Request body
Request body contents if the request type permits it. (POST/PUT)
Always be empty in 3.0.


Response message
----------------

A response message is sent as a reply to a request message. The policy
daemon produces this message. It should be sent immediately on the same
socket as the request came in on.

A response message uses the same VPOL header as a request.

rcode describes the policy daemon resulting code.
A successful response should return a 200-series rcode.
Any errors should return a 500-series rcode.

For libvmod-policy, the rcode will be the VCL_INT that the check() method
returns.

The vxid field should have the same value as the request vxid.

1) Metadata section. Currently always 0 bytes long.

2) Header section describing headers to add to req.http. \n delimited.
This can be used as a generic channel to pass data back to VCL.
Adding existing header names will yield undefined behaviour.


3) Body
If this section is set, the client request body will be replaced with the
content here. Previous content will be discarded.

Ignored in 3.0.


Error handling
''''''''''''''

Protocol errors seen by the policy daemon should be answered with an empty
VPOL message (meta, headers, body all 0) with a 400 response code.

Internal errors in the policy daemon should be returned with an em empty
VPOL message with a 500 response code.


Unresolved issues
-----------------

Should the policy daemon be told about the time constraint, so it can run as
many checks it can and still return a result before the timeout?

What about gzip? very important if we do this in vcl_backend_response as well.

* whitelist/blacklist this client for n seconds.
 - this can now be done through adding a header and writing some VCL.
